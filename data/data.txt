Tip your Amazon driver (on Amazon’s dime): If you’ve got an Alexa device at home, Amazon will pay your delivery driver an extra $5 if you say, “Alexa, thank my driver” after a delivery. Amazon could, of course, just pay drivers more to begin with…but that, depressingly, probably wouldn’t be a move that would get Amazon one of the most read headlines of the week.
